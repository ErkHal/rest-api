# rest-api
Simple take on building a Node.js + MongoDB REST API.

Connection to MongoDB instance requires the dbConfig.json file to be located at the root of the project with these values:
```
{
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password",
  "hostaddress": "host",
  "port": "portnumber",
  "database": "database"
}
```
